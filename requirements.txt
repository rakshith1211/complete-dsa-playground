# Requirements for Data Structures & Algorithms Implementation

# For running Python implementations
# No external dependencies required for basic data structures

# For running Python tests
# Python's built-in unittest module is used, so no additional dependencies needed

# For Java development (if using Maven)
# Note: This is just for reference. Actual Java project would need pom.xml for Maven
# junit-jupiter-api = 5.8.1
# junit-jupiter-engine = 5.8.1
