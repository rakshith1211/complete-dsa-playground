# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Implementation

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains implementations of classic data structures and algorithms in C, Java, Python, and JavaScript. Each implementation is designed with clarity, efficiency, and interview-prep in mind. The repo also includes unit tests and time complexity analysis for every algorithm.

## 🌐 Web Interface

This project also includes an interactive web interface that demonstrates the same data structures and algorithms directly in your browser. No installation required - just open `index.html` in your browser or run the included server.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: C, Java, Python, JavaScript
- **Testing**: JUnit (Java), unittest (Python), custom test cases (C)
- **Documentation**: Markdown with explanations & complexity notes
- **Web Interface**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 📂 Contents

### 🔹 Data Structures

**Linear Data Structures:**
- Singly Linked List - O(1) insert/delete at front, O(n) at end
- Doubly Linked List - O(1) insert/delete at both ends
- Circular Linked List - Circular reference implementation
- Stack (Array-based) - O(1) push/pop operations
- Queue (Array-based) - O(1) enqueue, O(n) dequeue
- Priority Queue - O(n) insert, O(1) dequeue
- Deque (Double-ended Queue) - O(1) operations at both ends

**Tree Data Structures:**
- Binary Search Tree - O(log n) avg, O(n) worst case
- AVL Tree (Self-balancing) - O(log n) guaranteed
- Min Heap - O(log n) insert/extract, O(1) peek

**Graph Data Structures:**
- Adjacency List representation
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) - O(V + E)
- DFS (Depth-First Search) - O(V + E)
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path - O(V²) or O(E log V)

**Hash-based:**
- Hash Table with collision handling - O(1) avg operations
