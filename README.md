# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Implementation

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains implementations of classic data structures and algorithms in C, Java, Python, and JavaScript. Each implementation is designed with clarity, efficiency, and interview-prep in mind. The repo also includes unit tests and time complexity analysis for every algorithm.

## 🌐 Web Interface

This project also includes an interactive web interface that demonstrates the same data structures and algorithms directly in your browser. No installation required - just open `index.html` in your browser or run the included server.
